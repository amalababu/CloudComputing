The cloud platform I chose is AWS
I used Mac OS Catalina for developing the command-line program
To run the command-line program: python3 access_gateway.py <url>
S3 bucket name: storage-web
URL of AWS Lambda API Gateway: https://ioqe1193xa.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/default/pageStore
Public DNS of your EC2 instance: ec2-34-221-168-247.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
Command to run the python code as a non-terminating background process: nohup sudo python3 poll_s3.py &
